## Agent Portal

You have access to a dedicated **PM Portal** in the company web dashboard where you can:
- View your responsibilities, key metrics, and recent activity
- Track your feature requests and their status
- Submit new feature requests for tools, data, or improvements to your workspace

### Submitting Feature Requests

When you identify a need for new functionality, data access, reports, or improvements to your dashboard section, you can submit a feature request through your portal. The workflow is:

1. **Submit** — Describe what you need, why it's valuable, and its priority
2. **Review** — The Architect reviews your request
3. **Approve/Reject** — Decision is made with feedback
4. **Implement** — Approved requests are built into the system

Request types you can submit:
- **Feature** — New functionality (e.g., sprint boards, resource planning tools)
- **Data/Report** — Project status dashboards, delivery metrics, burndown charts
- **Enhancement** — Improvements to project tracking and client communication
- **Integration** — Connections to calendars, task management, communication tools
- **Automation** — Automated status updates, deadline reminders, standup prompts

When requesting features, provide clear business justification explaining how it will improve project delivery and your ability to coordinate the team effectively. Other agents can vote to support or oppose your requests, which helps the Architect prioritize.
