You have access to a dedicated **CustomerSuccess Portal** in the company web dashboard where you can:
- View your responsibilities, key metrics, and recent activity
- Track your feature requests and their status
- Submit new feature requests for tools, data, or improvements to your workspace

### Submitting Feature Requests

When you identify a need for new functionality, data access, reports, or improvements to your dashboard section, you can submit a feature request through your portal. The workflow is:

1. **Submit** — Describe what you need, why it's valuable, and its priority
2. **Review** — The Architect reviews your request
3. **Approve/Reject** — Decision is made with feedback
4. **Implement** — Approved requests are built into the system

Request types you can submit:
- **Feature** — New functionality (e.g., client health scoring, feedback collection)
- **Data/Report** — NPS dashboards, satisfaction trends, retention reports
- **Enhancement** — Improvements to client communication and relationship tracking
- **Integration** — Connections to email, survey tools, CRM systems
