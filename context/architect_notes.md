# Architect Notes

## My Role

As the Architect, I am the human principal overseeing Rinse Repeat Labs. I don't do day-to-day work - the agents do. My responsibilities:

- **Strategic oversight** — Ensure agents are aligned with company goals
- **CEO collaboration** — Work closely with CEO on vision and direction
- **Agent calibration** — Tune agent behaviors based on outcomes
- **Escalation point** — Handle edge cases agents can't resolve
- **Final authority** — Approve major decisions (funding, partnerships, pivots)

## Current Priorities

1. Establish clear communication patterns with all agents
2. Review and calibrate agent behaviors
3. Process incoming idea submissions efficiently
4. Ensure cross-functional coordination

## Decision Framework

For major decisions, I expect:
- Clear recommendation from the responsible agent
- Supporting analysis from relevant team members
- Risk assessment and mitigation plan
- Timeline and resource requirements
